                <h2>How to play bowling</h2>
            </div>
            <div class="class-body">
                <p>The main goal is simple: knock down as many pins as you can, with as little throws as possible. You have ten frames to do so, each allowing you to do two (2) throws. </p>
                <p>The maximum possible score is 300, achievable by only doing strikes for the whole game (so a total of 12 in a row!).</p>
                <p>The scoring system may be a little complicated as first view, but here is an explanation of its inner workings:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <p><u>Strike:</u> you knocked down <b>all pins with only the first throw of the current frame</b>.</p>
                        <p><u>/!\</u> The second throw of this frame is skipped, you will play again at the next frame.</p>
                        <p><i>Filling the scoring sheet:</i> write an 'X' in the first box of the current frame. The second one will be left empty</p>
                        <p>Frame total score: 10 points, plus the score of the next frame.</p>
                        <p>For example:
                            <ul>
                                <li>the following two throws are '8' and '1', your frame will have a score of 10+8+1 = 19</li>
                                <li>the following frame is a Spare, you will have to wait until the Spare frame can be calculated before adding its score to the one of the Strike frame</li>
                                <li>the following frame is another Strike, you will have to wait until the second Strike frame can be calculated before ading its result to the current Strike frame</li>
                            </ul>
                            
                            However, <b>you can't have more than 30 points in a frame</b> if you manage to do more than three (3) strikes in a row.
                        </p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p><u>Spare:</u> you knocked down <b>all pins using the two throws of the current frame</b>.</p>
                        <p><i>Filling the scoring sheet:</i> write the number of pins hit in the first box of the current frame, and a '/' in the second one.</p>
                        <p>Frame total score: 10 points, plus the first throw of the next frame.</p>
                        <p>For example:
                            <ul>
                                <li>the very next throw is '7', your frame will have a score of 10+7 = 17</li>
                                <li>the next throw is a Strike, your frame will have a score of 10+10 = 20</li>
                            </ul>
                        </p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>In any other case, you simply note how many pins you took down with each throw.</p>
                        <p><i>Filling the scoring sheet:</i> write the number of pins hit with each throw in their respective boxes.</p>
                        <p>Frame total score: the total of your two throws.</p>
                        <p>For example:
                            <ul>
                                <li>you knocked down 5 then 3 pins, your frame will have a score of 5+3 = 8</li>
                                <li>you knocked down 0 then 9 pins, your frame will have a score of 0+9 = 9</li>
                            </ul>
                        </p>
                    </li>
                </ul>
                
                <p>
                    There is now a special case for the final frame, composed of three input fields as you maybe noticed. It's a bonus round. The third box will be unused unless you managed to do either a Strike or a Spare.
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            <p>You knocked down all pins with your first throw: it's a strike!</p>
                            <p>Note an 'X' in the first box. You can now use each of the two remaining throws as bonus throws, independant of each other.</p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <p>You knocked down all pins using two throws: it's a spare!</p>
                            <p>Treat the first two boxes as a normal Spare case. You can now do one last throw, which will be used </p>
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                </p>
